# Free Downloading Book Platform

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a robust and user-friendly book downloading platform that allows users to efficiently search and download free books from various sources. The platform will be designed to support multiple search criteria, including ISBN, author name, and book title, ensuring comprehensive search capabilities. Additionally, the platform will include features to streamline the book download process. To enhance performance and user experience, the implementation of caching strategies will be evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reducing search and download latency.

### Key Features

1. **Search Functionality:**
   - Implement a route that allows users to search for books using:
     - ISBN
     - Author name
     - Book title

2. **Download Functionality:**
   - Develop a dedicated route that enables users to download books by providing the book's title.

3. **API Integration:**
   - Create an API route for searching the ISBN of a book, which can then be used to initiate a search using the provided ISBN.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Research and implement caching mechanisms to improve response times and reduce server load. Evaluate the benefits of caching search results and frequently accessed data to enhance the overall performance and scalability of the platform.
